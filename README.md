# Data-Analysis-Project-with-SQLite

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing three distinct data analysis projects, each harnessing the power of SQLite to uncover valuable insights from different datasets. Here, I provide an overview of each project:

**1. Analyzing The Chicago City Socio-economic Dataset with SQLite:**

In this project, I delved into the Chicago City Socio-economic Dataset, leveraging SQLite for data analysis. My journey commenced with data retrieval using SQLite queries to extract relevant information. Subsequently, I utilized SQLite to further process and visualize the data. This project focuses on exploring various socio-economic factors within the city of Chicago, shedding light on key trends, disparities, and patterns that can inform policy decisions and community initiatives.

**2. Analyzing the Chicago Public Schools Dataset for the 2011-2012 Year with SQLite:**

The Chicago Public Schools Dataset for the 2011-2012 year contains extensive school-level performance data, which serves as the basis for school report cards. For this project, I employed SQLite to analyze this dataset comprehensively. SQLite queries facilitated data extraction and organization, while I used SQLite for conducting in-depth analysis and visualization. Through this project, I aimed to provide valuable insights into school performance, aiding educators, policymakers, and parents in making informed decisions to enhance educational outcomes.

**3. Analyzing Covid-19 World Data:**

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact worldwide, and data analysis has played a crucial role in understanding its spread and impact. In this project, I delved into Covid-19 world data using SQLite. I collected, cleaned, and analyzed data related to the pandemic's progression, infection rates, and other relevant metrics. By employing SQLite for data manipulation and visualization, I aimed to offer a comprehensive view of the pandemic's dynamics, helping stakeholders, healthcare professionals, and researchers make informed decisions.

Throughout these projects, I maintained a transparent and well-documented workflow, making it accessible for others to understand and reproduce the analysis. My GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for accessing the project's source code, datasets, documentation, and any other resources pertinent to these endeavors.

I invite you to explore each of these projects, provide feedback, and collaborate with me to gain deeper insights into these diverse datasets. Together, we can harness the power of data analysis to drive informed decision-making and address real-world challenges. Thank you for joining me on this data exploration journey.
