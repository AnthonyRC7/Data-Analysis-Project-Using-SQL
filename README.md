# Data-Analysis-Project-Using-SQL-and-Python
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing three distinct data analysis projects, each harnessing the power of SQL and Python to uncover valuable insights from different datasets. Here, I provide an overview of each project:

**1. Analyzing The Chicago City Socio-economic Dataset with SQL and Python:**
In this project, I dived into the Chicago City Socio-economic Dataset, leveraging SQL and Python for data analysis. My journey began with data retrieval using SQL queries to extract relevant information. I then utilized Python to further process and visualize the data. This project focuses on exploring various socio-economic factors within the city of Chicago, shedding light on key trends, disparities, and patterns that can inform policy decisions and community initiatives.

**2. Analyzing the Chicago Public Schools Dataset for the 2011-2012 Year with SQL and Python:**
The Chicago Public Schools Dataset for the 2011-2012 year contains extensive school-level performance data, which serves as the basis for school report cards. For this project, I employed SQL and Python to analyze this dataset comprehensively. SQL queries allowed me to extract and organize the necessary data, while Python enabled me to conduct in-depth analysis and visualization. Through this project, I aimed to provide valuable insights into school performance, helping educators, policymakers, and parents make informed decisions to enhance educational outcomes.

**3. Analyzing Covid-19 World Data:**
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact worldwide, and data analysis has played a crucial role in understanding its spread and impact. In this project, I delved into Covid-19 world data using SQL and Python. I collected, cleaned, and analyzed data related to the pandemic's progression, infection rates, and other relevant metrics. By employing SQL for data manipulation and Python for visualization, I aimed to offer a comprehensive view of the pandemic's dynamics, helping stakeholders, healthcare professionals, and researchers make informed decisions.

Throughout these projects, I maintained a transparent and well-documented workflow, making it easy for others to understand and reproduce the analysis. My GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for accessing the project's source code, datasets, documentation, and any other resources related to these endeavors.

I invite you to explore each of these projects, provide feedback, and collaborate with me to gain deeper insights into these diverse datasets. Together, we can harness the power of data analysis to drive informed decision-making and address real-world challenges. Thank you for joining me on this data exploration journey.
